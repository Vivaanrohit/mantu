C is a middle level language because,

1.it is like english/HLL.
2.it also having some symbols as used in ALL.

Compliation process

compiler is that converts HLL to MLL.
In C whole Program will be processed at a time.
It dislpay Error at a time.
it highlights the line containg the error when we will be looking for perticular error. 

Differentiate between an execution error and a syntax error. Give examples of execution and syntax errors

execution error are the errors which comes or Displayed at time of execution.

Syntax error comes at time of Compilation time.

Exe error are also called Run time error.

Syntax are also called complier errors.

Syntax are normal errors

Exe error may leads exceptions in programs.

3. (a) Write a program in 'C' to compute the series : 5

(x) + (x + n) + (x + n2) + (x + n3) +.....          2+(2+1)+(2+4)

for a total of m terms.

1. (a) It is said that 'C' is a middle level language. Mention those features of 'C' which enables this description. Give a short note on the 'compilation process in 'C'. 10

(b) Develop a flowchart and then write a program in 'C' to sort strings passed to the program through command line arguments. Also display the sorted strings. 10

(c) Define 'pointers' in C. How is a Pointer variable declared? Give examples and explain. Enumerate the utility of Pointer variables,with an example. 10

(d) Differentiate between : 21/2x2=5

(i) Function and sub routine

(ii) Structure and Union with examples of each.

(e) Give the precedence chart for the operator in 'C'.

(a) Differentiate between an execution error and a syntax error. Give examples of execution and syntax errors. 4

(b) Write and explain the act

ion of 'WHILE' statement. Develop a program to compute the average of every 3rd integer lying between 1 and 100. 8
(c) Write a program in 'C' to copy the contents of one file to another file. 8

3. (a) Write a program in 'C' to compute the series : 5

(x) + (x + n) + (x + n2) + (x + n3) +.....

for a total of m terms.

Where m,n and x are to be accepted by the user.

(b) Differentiate between goto statement,break and continue. 4

(c) What is an assignment operator? Give example of its usage. 3

(d) What is a pointer to an array? Differentiate it from an array of pointers. Write a program using pointer to array to calculate the sum of n given numbers. 8

4. (a) Implement Binary search in 'C' language. 8

(b) With every use of a memory allocation function,what function must be used to release allocated memory which is no longer used? Give syntax also. 4

(c) Write a recursive function in 'C' to count the number of nodes in a singly linked list. 4

5. (a) How are arrays processed in 'C'? Illustrate with the help of 2-D arrays as examples. 6

(b) Give syntax of gets ( ) and getch ( )? Also give examples of usage of scanf ( ) and printf (). 6

(c) A program in 'C' language contains the following declaration : 8

Static int x[8] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};

What is the meaning of :

(i) x?

(x + 2)?
