OSI
Open system interconnection
pc 1--------Communication--------pc2
why we use?
Multiple work divide into 7 layers
it makes the devices standard(one company and other company diff ideas)
helps us focus on perticular layer(some manufacture on physical,data etc)
helps us to truobleshoot in network easily by layer wise.


OSI Layer
7 Application layer
6 Presentation layer
5 Session layer
(1st 3 layer called as Upper or Software layer)

4Transport layer(Heart of OSI)

(last 3 layers called as Lower layer or Hardware layer)
3 Network layer
2 Data link Layer
1 Physical layer

                                 Application Layer
This layer is responsible for providing network Service to the user.
It is also known as Desktop layer.
Identification of Services is done using port numbers.

Ports are entry and Exit points to the layer.

Resource, sharing, Remote file, file Accessing, directory services

Total No. ports 0-65535
reserved Ports  0-1023
Open Client ports 1024-65535


Presentation layer
Responsible for converting data into standard format.
Examples: ASCII     EBCDIC       JPEG     MPEG     MIDI      WAV      MP3

following tasks are perform at presentation layer
Encoding--- Decoding
Encryption--Decryption
Compression--Decompression


Session Layer
Responsible for establishing, Maintaing and Terminating session.
Session ID works at session Layer.

Examples: RPC -> remote Procedure call
SQL -> Structured Query Language
NFS -> Network File System

Transport Layer
Responsible for end to end connectivity.
it is also known as heart of OSI

Tasks done at Transport Layer:
Message segementation, Acknologement and Message traffic control.

Identifying Services
Multiplexing and De multiplexing
Segementation
sequencing and Reassembling
Error correction
Flow control

Network Layer
reponsible for providing best path for data to reach the destination.
Logical Addressing works on this layer.
Router is a Network Layer Device.

It is divided into two parts.
1 Routed protocols
	eg..IP, IPX , Apple talk.
2.Routing protocols
	eg--RIP, IGRP, OSPF, EIGRP

DATA Link Layer

it is divided into two sub layers
1. LLC--Logical Link Control
	it talks about Wan protocols  eg...PPP,HDLC, Frame-relay
	(frame traffic control)
2.MAC--Media Access Control
it talks about Physical address.
it is a 48 bit address ie 12 digit Hexa decimal number.
It is also responsible for error detection
Devices working on data Link Layer are Switch, Bridge, NIC.

Physical Layer
responsible for electrical, mechanical and procedural checks.
data will be converted into binary (ie) zero and 1. 
data will be in the form of electrical form of electrical pulses if it is Coaxial or Twisted Pair cable and in the form of Light if it is Fibre Optic cable.
Devices working at physical layer are HUB Repeaters Cables Modems.
(data encoding Transmission techanique-Basebrand or broadband, physical Medium transmission)

DATA Flow from layer
7 Application --data
6 presentation ---data
5 session--data
4 transport--segment
3 Network--Packet
2 Data Link--Frame
1 physical---Bits
